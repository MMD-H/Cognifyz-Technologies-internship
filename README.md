�𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞: Understanding and summarizing key statistics in the dataset.

➡️ 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩𝐬 𝐈 𝐅𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐝:

✤𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭: I began by importing the dataset into Power BI. This powerful tool allowed me to handle and analyze the data efficiently.

✤ 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬: I then explored the dataset to understand its structure and data types. This step was crucial to identify key variables and ensure accurate analysis.

✤ 𝐂𝐚𝐥𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐬: Using the insights from the exploratory phase, I computed essential metrics such as average age, the percentage of individuals with various investments, and common savings objectives. These statistics provided a deeper understanding of the dataset's characteristics.

✤ 𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: To effectively communicate the findings, I created a series of insightful charts. These visualizations made the data more accessible and easier to interpret.

➡️ 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 & 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 :-
➤ The average age of individuals in the dataset is around 28 years, with a majority being male investors (62.5%). 
➤ Gold and Debentures are the most popular investment choices, followed closely by Government Bonds. 
➤ Retirement planning is the primary savings objective for most individuals, followed by health care and education. 
➤ The investment distribution shows that over 20% of individuals prefer Gold and Debentures, indicating a preference for relatively safer investment options. 
➤ Overall, the data highlights a young investor demographic focusing on long-term financial security.

► Hello Everyone, 
As a part of Internship at Cognifyz Technologies, I have been tasked to analyze investment durations and monitoring frequencies.

# TASK 4
# Investment Duration & Frequency

➡️𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞: To gain insights into how long investors hold their investments and how frequently they monitor them.

➡️ 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩𝐬 𝐈 𝐅𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐝 :

✤ 𝐃𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 :
 I visualized the distribution of investment durations using bar charts in Power BI. This helped in identifying that the majority of investors prefer medium-term investments (1-5 years), with the highest number of investments falling in the 3-5 year category.

✤ 𝐅𝐫𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 :
 I analyzed investment monitoring frequencies through bar charts. The findings revealed that most investors monitor their investments on a monthly basis. I then examined how this monitoring frequency impacts their investment choices.

➡️ 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 :

➤ 𝐈𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐀𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐞𝐬 : The most popular investment choice among investors is Mutual Funds (18), followed by Equity (10), Fixed Deposits (9), and Public Provident Fund (3).

➤ 𝐈𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐃𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 : A significant portion of investors prefer medium-term investments, with 3-5 years being the most common duration (19 investors), followed by 1-3 years (18 investors). Short-term investments (less than 1 year) and long-term investments (more than 5 years) are less preferred.

➤ 𝐈𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐅𝐫𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲: Most investors monitor their investments on a monthly basis (29), whereas weekly (7) and daily monitoring (4) are less common.

✨ This task enhanced my skills in data visualization and analysis using Power BI and provided valuable insights into investor behavior.
